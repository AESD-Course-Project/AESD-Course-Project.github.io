# **Project-Schedule**
Below is a table reflecting the goal and progress of the project's schedule.  
  

## Schedule:  
The milestone tasks below are associated with Sprints and associated issues which are labeled for it.  
The milestone/task/issue being worked on will either have the `WIP` label associated with it, or a pull request created for it.  
Any pending issues associated to a prior Sprint when that week's Sprint is finished, will have the current state/content of it copied to another issues, referencing the latest Spring, before being closed.   


The Course Project's `Projects` tab will automatically handle the kanban workflow of the project. Below is a synopsis of the scheduling.
