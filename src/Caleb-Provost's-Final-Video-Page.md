# Overview

This page provide's an overview of Caleb Provost's contribution to the AESD Final Project

# Video Outline
* Setup of build [environment](https://github.com/cu-ecen-5013/final-project-CalebProvost/blob/dl4t/Docker-Scratch-N-Sniff.md)
* Modifying &/or adding to [the yocto image](https://github.com/cu-ecen-5013/final-project-CalebProvost/tree/yocto-layer)

## Challenges
My most difficult challenge when implementing this project were:
* Differences in adding a layer to an existing yocto-distro compared to creating oneâ€™s own
* Building a distributable build environment which allows for team uniformity
* Debugging existing build tools
* Debugging Yocto image packaging
* Build system hyper-virtualization conflicts

## Lessons Learned
The most important topics I learned from this project were:
* Have clear and defined project definition which solidifies set work for each individual
* Containerization of a virtual build environment via Docker
* Debugging dependency issues
* Its always better to use an actual build environment compared to a virtualized one
